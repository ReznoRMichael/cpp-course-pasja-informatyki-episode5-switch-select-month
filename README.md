# Learning basics of C++ - 'switch' operator (select month)
> Training course - Pasja Informatyki, C++ course, episode 6 ( [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ib7LXBNfZ7g) )

## General info
The basics of using `switch` operator. Infinite `for` loop. Input a valid month number, and the program will show on the screen how many days the entered month number has. Includes a formula for calculating leap years. If the user entered 2, they have to also enter the year number. Input exception handling - if the entered value for a month is not a number, it will show a warning and exit the program. If the number doesn't match any months, the program will show info that the entered number is not a valid month. After each loop program waits for user input and clears the screen using `system("cls")`, then asks the user for the month again.
